# 05 - Reference glossary

> **Status key:** canonical names inherited from the source are **Established**. Implementation detail is **Proposed** unless called out otherwise. This file is the vocabulary and diagram-source reference; do not create alternate spellings in code.

## Canonical graph nodes

| Node | Canonical purpose |
|---|---|
| `ingest_build_context` | Validate request, build bounded M0/M1 context, retrieve scoped memory |
| `choose_route` | Choose clarify, direct, or supervised processing |
| `clarify` | Request the smallest missing user decision |
| `fast_direct_task` | Issue one safe deterministic task packet |
| `supervisor_plan` | Create a bounded dependency-aware plan |
| `validate_plan` | Validate scope, capabilities, targets, and policy needs |
| `dispatch_ready_tasks` | Dispatch ready task packets, potentially in parallel |
| `collect_merge` | Merge typed results, evidence, and receipts |
| `evaluate_progress` | Choose more dispatch, bounded replan, clarification, or completion |
| `bounded_replan` | Revise plan within fixed limits |
| `synthesize_outcome` | Produce a user-safe, evidence-grounded outcome |
| `respond_propose_memory` | Respond and submit a qualified memory proposal |

## Canonical roles and capability groups

| Name | Type | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Supervisor | Agent subgraph | Task planning, dependencies, dispatch decisions |
| Desktop Agent | Agent subgraph | Desktop/system discovery and action proposals |
| Discovery Agent | Agent subgraph | Research, evidence, source comparison |
| Knowledge Agent | Agent subgraph | Retrieval, consolidation, memory proposals |
| Task Worker | Worker graph | Scope enforcement, proposal-to-receipt lifecycle |
| Deterministic recipe | Code path | Known bounded operation with no open-ended planning |
| Tool | Registered adapter operation | One typed capability with schema/policy metadata |
| Trusted execution gateway | Rust-owned boundary | Sole authority to invoke adapters |

## Memory tiers

| Tier | Stores | Does not store | Primary backend | Retention / access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0 - Live World State | Current UI/runtime observations | Durable user facts or authority | Runtime snapshot; optional checkpoint ref | Short-lived, read-scoped |
| M1 - Working Context | Current task plan, selected excerpts, temporary notes | Raw files, secrets, native handles | Graph state/checkpoint | Request-scoped |
| M2 - Episodic Memory | Outcome of prior interactions and decisions | General truth without provenance | SQLite + retrieval index | Versioned, user-scoped |
| M3 - Semantic Memory | Durable facts/preferences with evidence | Unvalidated model claims | SQLite + full-text/vector index | Versioned, policy-scoped |
| M4 - Procedural Memory | Approved reusable procedures/recipes | Ad hoc privileged scripts | Registry/repository + SQLite metadata | Reviewed and versioned |
| M5 - Knowledge Artifacts | Reports, documents, structured notes | A replacement for canonical records | Filesystem + artifact metadata | Retained by artifact policy |

## Initial tools

| Tool ID | Type | Principal inputs | Principal output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `system_diagnostics` | Read-only tool | Requested checks, scope | Structured observations |
| `memory_save` | Internal write tool | Validated record reference | Memory ID/index status |
| `memory_lookup` | Read-only tool | Query, tiers, limit | Ranked references |
| `file_search` | Read-only tool | Allowed roots, pattern, limit | File metadata refs |
| `document_read` | Read-only tool | Artifact/file ref, mode | Extracted evidence refs |
| `document_create` | Reversible-write tool | Content ref, destination | Artifact ref/receipt |

## Canonical stores and core relationships

| Store | Canonical contents | Rebuildable? |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite | Session, request, task, proposal, approval, execution, receipt, memory/artifact metadata, audit | No |
| Checkpoint store | Serialized `MainGraphState` snapshots and write records | No for in-progress work |
| Filesystem artifact root | Documents and other artifacts | No unless backed up |
| Full-text/vector index | Retrieval projections keyed to canonical records | Yes |
| Runtime memory | UI/session handles, M0, live adapter state | Yes; never the only durable record |

Canonical status values: `received`, `planning`, `running`, `awaiting_approval`, `reconciling`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`. The gateway alone may report `unknown_outcome`.

## Mermaid source

These diagrams are concise source equivalents of the vector PDF. They use the same names as the documents. The PDF is the preferred reading format; the Mermaid remains useful for version control and later regeneration.
